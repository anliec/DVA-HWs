Q3A)\
The Feature 2 (plasma glucose) vs. Feature 5 (Insulin) combination is better at separating the classes, as is clearly visible from the scatterplot. A linear classifier may also work well to a certain extent.\
The bmi vs blood pressure scatterplot, results in points that overlap making it harder to separate them into 2 different classes.\

For data that ranges over several magnitudes, a better visualization can be seen using a non linear transformation. It is seen that the log and sqrt scale transformations cause points to be distributed more uniformly through the graph, resulting in better visualization}
