Q 1.a\
\
Excel is used. The \'93Year\'94 column has been removed since we only consider year 2012. Missing values were replaced with 0s and columns that contained only 0s were deleted. Headers are in bold, white on black background and easily noticed. Data to ink ratio is maintained at good level this way.\
\
Q 1.b\
Multiple line chart depicts the crime rates for different crimes.\
As can be seen from the graph, property crime rate is the highest and hence the thickness of the line could be increased. The thickness of the line could be made directly proportional to the crime rate. Higher the crime rate, thicker the line. \
